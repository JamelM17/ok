# FlappyGame

A game written in [Jack.](https://en.everybodywiki.com/Jack_(programming_language)  
Running the game would require [downloading the Nand2Tetris software suite](https://www.nand2tetris.org/software)  
However, I imagine most people just want to see it in action: [video here.](https://www.loom.com/share/1f78c7437aa34cac8af9a2fa5db60d80)

This project was peer graded. Here is some feedback from my peers who also took the Nand2Tetris course:

> Wowza. You employ several clever techniques alongside some cool math and an admirable level of precision and organization to make this program. For example, I see you created your own modulo operation using the fact that (int x / int y) \* int y != int x , and then used it to create pseudo-random pipe generation. Also, I think how you created a variable called "speed" in the bird object and then used it to tell whether or not your bird was moving upwards and then translated your bird accordingly was pretty interesting. I feel like I could spend a very long time studying this and still not understand how all of it works. This program demonstrated how awesome object based programming can be.

> Game structure is good, I have tried to play the game but I think I need more practice to cross the pipes. Overall, great work!
